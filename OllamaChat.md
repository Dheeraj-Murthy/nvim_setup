hello What is your question?

# My Title

i want to know the code for fibbonacci of n The Fibonacci sequence is a series
of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting
from 0 and 1. The sequence looks like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on.
To calculate the nth Fibonacci number, you can use a recursive formula or a
loop.

Recursive Formula: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

Base Cases: F(0) = 0 F(1) = 1

Example: To calculate the 5th Fibonacci number (F(5)), you would use the
recursive formula like this: F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = F(3) + F(2) = F(2) + F(1) +
F(0) = 2 + 1 + 0 = 3

Loop: You can also use a loop to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. Here's an
example in JavaScript:

```
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n; // Base case
  else {
    let a = 0, b = 1;
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
      let temp = a + b;
      a = b;
      b = temp;
    }
    return b;
  }
}
```

In this example, the function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the
`n`th Fibonacci number. It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in
which case it returns `n`. Otherwise, it initializes two variables `a` and `b`
with the values 0 and 1 respectively, and then enters a loop that calculates the
sum of `a` and `b`, storing the result in `temp`, and updating `a` and `b` to
the new values. The loop continues until `i` reaches `n`, at which point it
returns the value of `b`.

You can test this function by calling it with a value for `n`:

```
console.log(fibonacci(5)); // Output: 3
```

do know how to set up lspconfig in nvim To set up LSP (Language Server Protocol)
in Neovim, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary plugins for your language server. For example, if you
   want to use the TypeScript Language Server, you would need to install the
   `typescript-language-server` package using npm or yarn.
2. Add the following lines to your Neovim configuration file (usually located at
   `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`):

```vim
let g:LanguageClient_serverCommands = {
    \ 'typescript': ['typescript-language-server', '--stdio'],
\}

let g:LanguageClient_rootMarkers = ['.git']

let g:LanguageClient_autoStart = 1
```

This configuration sets up the `typescript-language-server` as the language
server for TypeScript files, and sets the root markers to the `.git` directory.
The `autoStart` option is set to `1` so that Neovim will automatically start the
language server when opening a TypeScript file. 3. Start Neovim and open a
TypeScript file. You should see the language server running in the background,
and you can use the built-in language client features like code completion and
type checking.

Note that this is just an example configuration, and you may need to adjust it
depending on your specific needs and the version of Neovim you are using. Also,
make sure that the `typescript-language-server` package is installed and
available in your system's PATH.
