# 💤 Dheeraj's Neovim Config

This is my personal Neovim setup, built on top of [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) — a fast, modular, and lazy-loaded Neovim configuration framework.

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you're new to LazyVim, check out the official [installation guide](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

Once installed, clone this repo into your Neovim config directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name ~/.config/nvim
```

## 📦 Features

- ⚡ Lazy-loaded plugins for better performance
- 🧠 Preconfigured LSP, formatting, and diagnostics
- 🌈 Beautiful UI with custom themes
- 🛠️ My tweaks and keymaps for productivity

## 🔧 Customizations

This setup includes my own plugin preferences, key mappings, and workflow-specific tweaks. Feel free to explore and adapt!
